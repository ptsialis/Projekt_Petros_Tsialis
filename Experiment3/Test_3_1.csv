From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.
So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community.

This dataset has daily level information on the number of affected cases, deaths and recovery etc. from coronavirus. It also contains various other parameters like average life expectancy, population density, smocking population etc. which users can find useful in further prediction that they need to make.

From World Health Organization - On 31 December 2019, WHO was alerted to several cases of pneumonia in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China. The virus did not match any other known virus. This raised concern because when a virus is new, we do not know how it affects people.
So daily level information on the affected people can give some interesting insights when it is made available to the broader data science community.
